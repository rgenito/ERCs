## Simple Summary

A standard interface for dynamic-staking tokens that communicate their economic market capitalization and are programmed to coordinate with other standard tokens.

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for dynamically staked tokens that will interact with other standard tokens within smart contracts.  This standard provides basic functionality that accounts for the tokens that were removed from circulation (burned), allocated to a dynamic stake (mining), and exist in circulation as any other “normal” ERC-20 token having the ability to be transferred and approved for spending by another on-chain third party “as normal”.  This standard allows the value of tokens to be affected by a separate virtual supply of tokens, and furthermore, provides basic functionality that allows another on-chain third party to work in conjunction with the virtual supply.

This standard’s support for more comprehensive supply accounting and dynamically staked elements, such as a virtual supply, can have a significant impact on advanced tokenomics and other aspects of decentralized finance.  Therefore, the following standard also introduces methods that allow the implementation of batching transactions and give greater insights into the implemented contract itself, such as the ERC standard itself and market capitalization insights.

  The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the EIP solves. It should not describe how the EIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the EIP should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.

  With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your EIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.

Everyone and their mother is creating tokens to basically represent shares of an idea, meme, centrally- (company-) backed asset, or shares of a decentralized company.  As researchers and developers discover new utility for software-driven assets (smart contracts), a new standard is here proposed to standardize new elements, ideas, and requirements for tokens that directly work with one another and also describe their relative economic value and market capitalization.

An economic standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications and standardizes access to its economic parameters.  While this is useful for wallets, decentralized exchanges, and market capitalization analysis, engineers can use this standard to simplify the complex accounting of dynamically staked tokens, save the end user the significant transaction costs incurred by these types of tokens, and implement the token’s economic impact when it is exchanged (“swapped”) with another token or vice versa.

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (besu, erigon, ethereumjs, go-ethereum, nethermind, or others).

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## Token

### ERC-20 Compatibility

The following methods are preserved and identical to ERC-20.  For more information on ERC-20, visit: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20

 - name (optional)
 - symbol (optional)
 - decimals (optional)
 - totalSupply
 - balanceOf
 - transfer
 - transferFrom
 - approve
 - allowance

In regard to the ```totalSupply```, since the Mining Supply holds dynamically staked tokens, these tokens may be considered part of the ```totalSupply``` due to the ERC-1618 contract's implementation of dynamically staked tokens.  As with all other ERC_20 compatibility methods and events, ERC-1618 uses the method name ```totalSupply``` only for ERC-20 compatibility.  Ultimately, its implementation may differ.

The ```transfer```, ```allowance``` and related methods may alter the ERC-20 standard depending on the token's economic implementation.

### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.8.23` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!

#### ERC1618_MINING_ACCOUNT

Returns the account - whether it is EOA, contract, or invalid - for blockchain analysis tools to consider as the contract’s Mining accountancy.

This must be unique for all ERC-1618 contract implementations, and the value must not be the NULL address!  The deployed contract address itself can be the Mining Account or any other account.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function ERC1618_MINING_ACCOUNT() public view returns (address)
```


#### ERC1618_EXILED_ACCOUNT

Returns the account - whether it is EOA, contract, or invalid - for blockchain analysis tools to consider as the contract’s Exiled accountancy.

This may or may not be unique for all ERC-1618 contract implementations, and the value must not be the NULL address!  If the ERC-1618 contract does not have a separate account for the Exiled Account, the developer may use the global "Exiled" account address:

> 0x11ED000000000000000000000000000000000000

That is 11ED followed by 36 zeros, or X-Iled (pronounced “EX-ILED”).

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function ERC1618_EXILED_ACCOUNT() public view returns (address)
```


#### erc
#### supply
#### virtualSupply
#### circulatingSupply
#### miningSupply
#### exiledSupply
#### maxSupply
#### entireSupply
#### price
#### marketcap
#### fdmc
#### tvl
#### batchTx
#### batchTxFrom
#### transferAll
#### transferAllFrom
#### exodus
#### receiver

### Events

ERC-20 Compatibility:
* Transfer
* Approval

#### MultiTransfer

### Developer Notes

To understand the ERC-1618 standard, you must understand that the biggest difference from ERC-20 is the internal accounting.  Accounting is an important part for newer smart contracts that have complex operations and tokenomics.  The figure (below) illustrates ERC-20 accounting.

_Note the following important abbreviation._

NIS = Not Implemented in the Standard.

[Figure ERC-20]


| From | To | Internal Name | Description |
| ---- | -- | ---- | ----------- |
| NULL | NULL | N/A | (NIS) May be used to log special events. |
| NULL | Total Supply | _mint | New tokens are minted into the Total Supplyl. |
| Total Supply | Total Supply | transfer* | (NIS) May be used to log special events. |
| Total Supply | NULL | _burn | Tokens are removed from supply.  Although the value is logged, it is not accounted (recorded in accounting) nor available to the smart contract. |

Note that there is no account of how many tokens have been minted, nor is there an account of how many tokens have been burned.  These accounts are important for the advanced tokenomics and market capitalization research necessary by the tokens of today and the future.

Not every implementation of the ERC-1618 abstract will use these functions; however, the internal functions are available to assist with the complex accounting between tokens for dynamically staked (the “Mining Supply”) and the recorded burned supply (the “Exiled Supply”).

NIS = Not Implemented in the Standard.  These accounting operations are reserved for the customized implementation that is based on ERC-1618.

[Figure ERC-1618]

| From | To | Internal Name | Description |
| ---- | -- | ---- | ----------- |
| NULL | NULL | _null | (NIS) May be used to log special events. |
| NULL | Normal | _mint | New tokens are minted into the Normal Supply. |
| NULL | Mining | _mintMining | (NIS) New tokens are minted into the Mining Supply. |
| NULL | Exiled | _mintExiled | (NIS) New tokens are minted into the Exiled Supply. |
| Normal | NULL | _burn | Normal token burning that is not recorded in the smart contract's accounting. |
| Normal | Normal | transfer* | Transfer tokens between accounts. |
| Normal | Mining | _mine | These tokens will be preserved for Mining (dynamic staking). |
| Normal | Exiled | _exile | Token burning that is recorded (accounted for) in the smart contract's accounting. |
| Mining | NULL | _burnMining | (NIS) Tokens are burned from the Mining Supply and are not recorded in the contract's accounting. |
| Mining | Normal | _unmine | The tokens go back to the Normal supply and are not subject to the contract's dynamic staking rules. |
| Mining | Mining | N/A | (NIS) May be used to log special events, such as preserved token ownership being transferred from one account to another. |
| Mining | Exiled | _exileMining | The Mining Supply is Exiled.  In other words, the tokens cease to be preserved for dynamic mining and are burned in a manner that is accounted.  This can be used for temporarily moving supply so that the "Mining Supply" can be used to calculate the smart contract's average economic performance. |
| Exiled | NULL | N/A | (NIS) An amount of the Exiled Supply is removed from accounting. |
| Exiled | Normal | _admit | Exiled Supply, which was once banished (exiled) from Normal or Mining accounting, will now be "admitted" back into the Normal Supply. |
| Exiled | Mining | N/A | (NIS) Supply moves from the Exiled to the Mining Supply. |
| Exiled | Exiled | N/A | (NIS) May be used to log special events, such as signaling to data analysts that this portion of the Exiled supply will indefinitely remain in the Exiled Supply. |

### Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

TBD

### Backwards Compatibility

<!--

  This section is optional.

  All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Test Cases

<!--
  This section is optional for non-Core EIPs.

  The Test Cases section should include expected input/output pairs, but may include a succinct set of executable tests. It should not include project build files. No new requirements may be be introduced here (meaning an implementation following only the Specification section should pass all tests here.)
  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting

## Reference Implementation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting

Needs discussion.
